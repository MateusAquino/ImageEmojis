# 🍡 ImageEmojis
Unlock every single Discord emoji as images/gifs (Nitro Alternative).

## 🚀 Setup
First, make sure you have [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app) installed.  
Once you're done, download ImageEmojis script from the [releases](https://github.com/MateusAquino/ImageEmojis/releases) page or [directly](https://github.com/MateusAquino/ImageEmojis/blob/main/ImageEmojis.plugin.js) from source.  
Then, simply move it to BetterDiscord Plugin's folder from Discord settings.  
  
**Linux**: `~/.config/BetterDiscord/plugins`  
**Windows**: `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\plugins`  

## 💻 Preview
Grayscale filter is removed from emoji list + right-click'ing them adds the URL to the chat:

## ⚙️ Settings
You can also set up a fixed size for all emojis (concating `&size=n` to every single url),  
this feature will let you automate that.
